## For XCode 5. dev6 support
This plugin now works in Xcode 5 dev6 and hopefully the next releases of Xcode:-D.
This branch is experimental!

## BTGisterPost for XCode 5.\*  
A small plug-in for Xcode 5.\* that allows for posting of Gist's directly from Xcode.
It is purposely meant to be very small and not to intrusive.
It is not the most pretty little thing, but it gets the job done.   
Think of it as your friendly Gist hammer:-D.  

__It has been tested in Xcode 5.0 dev 6 on OS X 10.9\* and will NOT work in Xcode 4 and below
since Xcode 5 now uses ARC.__

### Getting started
If you just want to install the plug-in the best way is to use the XCode package manager [Alcatraz](http://mneorr.github.com/Alcatraz).
This plug-in is available in the package list, just look for **BTGisterPost** and check it for installation.  
You can also build the plug-in directly from the source:
* Clone this repository.
* Open the project in Xcode 5+
* Build the solution -- the plug-in will automatically be installed.
* Restart Xcode for the plug-in to be activated.

#### Features
* The plugin will create a menupoint in the `edit` menu: `Post Gist To Github`. allowing you to post your gist.
* The plugin creates the shortcut `‚å• + c` i.e. `(option + c)` for faster posting of gist's.
 
* It will use the currently selected text to create a gist. 
* It will automatically retrieve the name of the current file and use it as the default gist name 
* It uses the built in __User Notificationcenter in OS X__ to inform of the progress of the Gist post.
Clicking the notification will open the gist in a browser.

##### GitHub user credentials.
To post a gist the plug-in requires a **username*** and **password** to a valid GitHub account. Your information is not in any way used for anything else but creating Gist's. If you have any concerns feel free to check the source.

### Uninstall
To uninstall the plug-in simply delete it from the folder where it resides:
`~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/BTGisterPost.xcplugin`  
Or if using **Alzatraz** just uncheck the plug-in in the package list, and it should be removed.  
Remember to restart Xcode for the removal to take effect.

###
The project uses [Cocoa Pods](http://cocoapods.org/) so make sure you have it installed on your system and follow normal 
pod procedure.
