## For XCode 5*
Please checkout https://github.com/LogikBlitz/BTGisterPost_Xcode5 for XCode 5 support.

## BTGisterPost for XCode 4.\*  
A small plug-in for Xcode 4.\* that allows for posting of Gist's directly from Xcode.
It is purposely meant to be very small and not to intrusive.
It is not the most pretty little thing, but it gets the job done.   
Think of it as your friendly Gist hammer:-D.  

__It has been tested in Xcode 4.6.2 on OS X 10.8\*__ but should work just fine in Xcode 4.\* and OS X 10.7 (Without user notifications).

### Getting started
If you just want to install the plug-in the best way is to use the XCode package manager [Alcatraz](http://mneorr.github.com/Alcatraz).
This plug-in is available in the package list, just look for **BTGisterPost** and check it for installation.  
You can also build the plug-in directly from the source:
* Clone this repository.
* Open the project in Xcode 4+
* Build the solution -- the plug-in will automatically be installed.
* Restart Xcode for the plug-in to be activated.

#### How to use the plug-in
In Xcode the plug-in will add a new menu-point in the `edit` menu: `Post Gist To Github`.
Alternatively you can also use the shortcut `‚å• + c` i.e. `(option + c)`
to trigger the plug-in.  
It will use the currently selected text to create a gist.  
If no text is selected all text in the current open document will be converted into a gist.

##### GitHub user credentials.
To post a gist the plug-in requires a **username*** and **password** to a valid GitHub account. Your information is not in any way used for anything else but creating Gist's. If you have any concerns feel free to check the source.

### Uninstall
To uninstall the plug-in simply delete it from the folder where it resides:
`~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/BTGisterPost.xcplugin`  
Or if using **Alzatraz** just uncheck the plug-in in the package list, and it should be removed.  
Remember to restart Xcode for the removal to take effect.

### Dependencies
The plug-in uses a modified version of [UAGithubEngine](https://github.com/owainhunt/uagithubengine) for GitHub communication. The framework has been scaled down a bit, and converted to not use ARC, since ARC is not supported in Xcode plug-ins.
