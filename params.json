{"name":"BTGisterPost","tagline":"A small plugin for Xcode that allows for posting of Gist's directly from Xcode.","body":"## BTGisterPost for XCode 4.\\*  \r\nA small plug-in for Xcode 4.\\* that allows for posting of Gist's directly from Xcode.\r\nIt is purposely meant to be very small and not to intrusive.\r\nIt is not the most pretty little thing, but it gets the job done.   \r\nThink of it as your friendly Gist hammer:-D.  \r\n\r\n__It has been tested in Xcode 4.6.2 on OS X 10.8\\*__ but should work just fine in Xcode 4.\\* and OS X 10.7 (Without user notifications).\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nIf you just want to install the plug-in the best way is to use the XCode package manager [Alcatraz](http://mneorr.github.com/Alcatraz).\r\nThis plug-in is available in the package list, just look for **BTGisterPost** and check it for installation.  \r\nYou can also build the plug-in directly from the source:\r\n* Clone this repository.\r\n* Open the project in Xcode 4+\r\n* Build the solution -- the plug-in will automatically be installed.\r\n* Restart Xcode for the plug-in to be activated.\r\n\r\n#### How to use the plug-in\r\nIn Xcode the plug-in will add a new menu-point in the `edit` menu: `Post Gist To Github`.\r\nAlternatively you can also use the shortcut `‚å• + c` i.e. `(option + c)`\r\nto trigger the plug-in.  \r\nIt will use the currently selected text to create a gist.  \r\nIf no text is selected all text in the current open document will be converted into a gist.\r\n\r\n##### GitHub user credentials.\r\nTo post a gist the plug-in requires a **username*** and **password** to a valid GitHub account. Your information is not in any way used for anything else but creating Gist's. If you have any concerns feel free to check the source.\r\n\r\n### Uninstall\r\nTo uninstall the plug-in simply delete it from the folder where it resides:\r\n`~/Library/Application\\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/BTGisterPost.xcplugin`  \r\nOr if using **Alzatraz** just uncheck the plug-in in the package list, and it should be removed.  \r\nRemember to restart Xcode for the removal to take effect.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nThe plug-in uses a modified version of [UAGithubEngine](https://github.com/owainhunt/uagithubengine) for GitHub communication. The framework has been scaled down a bit, and converted to not use ARC, since ARC is not supported in Xcode plug-ins.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributions\r\nIf you would like to contribute to the plug-in, simply fork the project and submit a pull request.
