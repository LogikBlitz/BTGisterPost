{"name":"Btgisterpost","tagline":"A small plugin for Xcode that allows for posting of Gist's directly from Xcode.","body":"### BTGisterPost\r\n============\r\n\r\nA small plugin for Xcode 4.\\* that allows for posting of Gist's directly from Xcode.\r\nIt is purposely meant to be very small and not to intrusive.\r\nIt is not the most pretty little thing, but it gets the job done.\r\nThink of it a you friendly Gist hammer:-D.  \r\n\r\nIt has been tested in Xcode 4.6.2 on OS X 10.8*.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nTo install the plugin do the following.\r\n* Clone repo.\r\n* Copy the precompiled plugin from the folder: \r\n`\"PathToRepo/PluginIsHere/BTGisterPost.xcplugin\"`\r\nto `~/Library/Application\\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`\r\n* Alternatively build the solution and the plugin will automatically be installed. Remember to restart XCode for the plugin to be activated.\r\n\r\n#### Alcatraz\r\nI will be submitting the plugin for [Alcatraz](http://mneorr.github.com/Alcatraz) in a short while. This will make it simpler to get and install the plugin.\r\n\r\n#### How to use the plugin\r\nIn Xcode the plugin will add a new menupoint in the `edit` menu: `Post Gist To Github`.\r\nAlternatively you can also use the shortcut `‚å• + c` i.e. `(option + c)`\r\nto trigger the plugin.  \r\nIt will post the currently selected text as a gist.\r\nIf no text is selected all text in the current open document will be converted into a gist.\r\n\r\n#### Github user credentials.\r\nTo post a gist the plugin requires a username and login to a valid GitHub account. Your information is not in any way used for anything else but creating Gist's. If you have any concerns feel free to check the source.\r\n\r\n### Uninstall\r\nTo uninstall the plugin simply delete it from the folder where it resides:\r\n`~/Library/Application\\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/BTGisterPost.xcplugin`\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nThe plugin uses a modified version of [UAGithubEngine](https://github.com/owainhunt/uagithubengine) for GitHub communication. The framework has been scaled down a bit, and converted to not use ARC, since ARC is not supported in Xcode plugins.\r\n\r\n### Future Improvements\r\n* Better visual layout. Especially modal view with user/password request needs some work.\r\n* Catching return key to commit gist instead of using the mouse to push buttons.\r\n* Better validation of username and password fields.\r\n\r\n### Contributions\r\nIf you would like to contribute to the plugin, simply fork the project and submit a pull request.
